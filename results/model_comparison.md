## Top 5 Most Important Features
1. **Humidity3pm** ‚Äì Afternoon humidity levels
2. **Pressure9am** ‚Äì Morning atmospheric pressure
3. **Sunshine** ‚Äì Hours of bright sunshine
4. **Cloud3pm** ‚Äì Afternoon cloud coverage
5. **WindGustSpeed** ‚Äì Maximum wind gust speed

## Model Performance Analysis
- Both initial models perform well on the majority class (No Rain) with ~93‚Äì94% recall.
- Rain detection is more challenging with only ~51‚Äì52% recall initially.
- Feature engineering and threshold tuning significantly improved recall to **77.9%**.
- Precision dropped with increased recall, indicating a trade-off.

## Best Model By Criteria

üéØ **Best Recall (Rain Detection)**: Feature Enhanced with Custom Threshold  
‚Üí Catches 77.9% of rainy days

üîç **Best Precision (Fewer False Alarms)**: Original (Accuracy Optimized)  
‚Üí 68.4% of rain predictions are correct

‚öñÔ∏è **Best F1-Score (Balance)**: Feature Enhanced  
‚Üí F1-Score: 0.606

üìä **Best Overall Accuracy**: Original (Accuracy Optimized)  
‚Üí Accuracy: 82.8%

## Limitations
- Still misses ~22% of rainy days
- High false positive rate in high-recall models
- Only trained on Melbourne data ‚Äì may not generalize

## Recommendations
- Use **Feature Enhanced with Custom Threshold** for rain-sensitive applications
- Use **Original** for fewer false alarms
- Use **Feature Enhanced** for balanced performance

## Future Improvements
- Use oversampling/SMOTE for better class balance
- Add time-series features or rolling weather metrics
- Try boosting models like XGBoost or LightGBM
- Explore recurrent models (LSTM) for temporal patterns
